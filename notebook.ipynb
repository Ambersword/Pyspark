However, local workstations have their limitations and cannot handle extremely large datasets. \n\nThis is where a distributed processing system like Apache Spark comes in. Distributed processing is a setup in which multiple processors are used to run an application. Instead of trying to process large datasets on a single computer, the task can be divided between multiple devices that communicate with each other.\n\nWith Apache Spark, users can run queries and machine learning workflows on petabytes of data, which is impossible to do on your local device.\n\nThis framework is even faster than previous data processing engines like Hadoop, and has [increased in popularity](https://datafloq.com/read/why-apache-spark-becoming-more-popular) in the past eight years. Companies like IBM, Amazon, and Yahoo are using Apache Spark as their computational framework.\n\nThe ability to analyze data and train machine learning models on large-scale datasets is a valuable skill to have if you want to become a data scientist. Having the expertise to work with big data frameworks like Apache Spark will set you apart from others in the field.\n\n_**Practice using Pyspark with hands-on exercises in our [Introduction to PySpark course](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-pyspark).**_",

      "source": "## What is PySpark?\n\nPySpark is an interface for Apache Spark in Python. With PySpark, you can write Python and SQL-like commands to manipulate and analyze data in a distributed processing environment. To learn the basics of the language, you can take Datacamp’s [Introduction to PySpark](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-pyspark) course. This is a beginner program that will take you through manipulating data, building machine learning pipelines, and tuning models with PySpark.\n\n## What is PySpark used for?\n\nMost data scientists and analysts are familiar with Python and use it to implement machine learning workflows. PySpark allows them to work with a familiar language on large-scale distributed datasets.\n\nApache Spark can also be used with other data science programming languages like R. If this is something you are interested in learning, the[ Introduction to Spark with sparklyr in R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-spark-with-sparklyr-in-r) course is a great place to start.\n\n## Why PySpark?\n\nCompanies that collect terabytes of data will have a big data framework like Apache Spark in place. To work with these large-scale datasets, knowledge of Python and R frameworks alone will not suffice. \n\nYou need to learn a framework that allows you to manipulate datasets on top of a distributed processing system, as most data-driven organizations will require you to do so. PySpark is a great place to get started, since its syntax is simple and can be picked up easily if you are already familiar with Python.\n\nThe reason companies choose to use a framework like PySpark is because of how quickly it can process big data. It is faster than libraries like Pandas and Dask, and can handle larger amounts of data than these frameworks. If you had over petabytes of data to process, for instance, Pandas and Dask would fail but PySpark would be able to handle it easily.\n\nWhile it is also possible to write Python code on top of a distributed system like Hadoop, many organizations choose to use Spark instead and use the PySpark API since it is faster and can handle real-time data. With PySpark, you can write code to collect data from a source that is continuously updated, while data can only be processed in batch mode with Hadoop. \n\nApache Flink is a distributed processing system that has a Python API called PyFlink, and is actually faster than Spark in terms of performance. However, Apache Spark has been around for a longer period of time and has better community support, which means that it is more reliable. \n\nFurthermore, PySpark provides fault tolerance, which means that it has the capability to recover loss after a failure occurs. The framework also has in-memory computation and is stored in random access memory (RAM). It can run on a machine that does not have a hard-drive or SSD installed.\n\n### Dataset\n\nWe will be using Datacamp’s [e-commerce dataset](https://www.datacamp.com/workspace/datasets/dataset-r-e-commerce) for all the analysis in this tutorial, so make sure to have it downloaded. We’ve  renamed the file to “datacamp_ecommerce.csv” and saved it to the  parent directory, and you can do the same so it’s easier to code along.\n\n",

For instance, if you visit Starbucks only during the summer to purchase cold beverages, you can be segmented as a “seasonal shopper” and enticed with special promotions curated for  the summer season.\n\nData scientists usually build unsupervised machine learning algorithms such as K-Means clustering or hierarchical clustering to perform customer segmentation. These models are great at identifying similar patterns between user groups that often go unnoticed by the human eye.\n\nIn this tutorial, we will use K-Means clustering to perform customer segmentation on the e-commerce dataset we downloaded earlier.\n\nBy the end of this tutorial, you will be familiar with the following concepts:\n\n- Reading csv files with PySpark\n- Exploratory Data Analysis with PySpark\n- Grouping and sorting data\n- Performing arithmetic operations\n- Aggregating datasets\n- Data Pre-Processing with PySpark\n- Working with datetime values\n- Type conversion\n- Joining two dataframes\n- The rank() function\n- PySpark Machine Learning\n- Creating a feature vector\n- Standardizing data\n- Building a K-Means clustering model\n- Interpreting the model\n\n\n### Step 1: Creating a SparkSession\n\nA SparkSession is an entry point into all functionality in Spark, and is required if you want to build a dataframe in PySpark.

If we decide on three clusters, for instance, then we will have three customer segments.\n\nThe most popular technique used to decide on how many clusters to use in K-Means is called the “elbow-method.”\n\nThis is done simply running the K-Means algorithm for a wide range of clusters and visualizing the model results for each cluster. The plot will have an inflection point that looks like an elbow, and we just pick the number of clusters at this point.\n\nRead this Datacamp [K-Means clustering tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/k-means-clustering-python) to learn more about how the algorithm works.\n\nLet’s run the following lines of code to build a K-Means clustering algorithm from 2 to 6 clusters:",

They also don’t visit the site often. This indicates that they might be newer customers who have just started doing business with the company.\n\n\n \n\n- Cluster 2: Customers in this segment display medium recency and frequency and spend a lot of money on the platform. This indicates that they tend to buy high-value items or make bulk purchases.\n\n\n \n\n- Cluster 3: The final segment comprises users who display high recency and make frequent purchases on the platform. However, they don’t spend much on the platform, which might mean that they tend to select cheaper items in each purchase.\n\n\nTo go beyond the predictive modelingmodelling concepts covered in this course, you can take the [Machine Learning with PySpark](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/machine-learning-with-pyspark) course on Datacamp.\n\n## Learning PySpark From Scratch - Next Steps:\n\nIf you managed to follow along with this entire PySpark tutorial, congratulations! You have now successfully installed PySpark onto your local device, analyzed an e-commerce dataset, and built a machine learning algorithm using the framework.\n\nOne caveat of the analysis above is that it was conducted with 2,500 rows of ecommerce data collected on a single day. The outcome of this analysis can be solidified if we had a larger amount of data to work with, as techniques like RFM modeling are usually applied onto months of historical data.\n\nHowever, you can take the principles learned  in this article and apply them to a wide variety of larger datasets in the unsupervised machine learning space.\n\nCheck out this [cheat sheet](https://www.datacamp.com/cheat-sheet/pyspark-cheat-sheet-spark-in-python) by Datacamp to learn more about PySpark’s syntax and its modules.\n\nFinally, if you’d like to go beyond the concepts covered in this tutorial and learn the fundamentals of programming with PySpark, you can take the [Big Data with PySpark](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/big-data-with-pyspark) learning track on Datacamp.
